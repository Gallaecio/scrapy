"Although Python makes sending e-mails relatively easy via the `smtplib`_ "
"library, Scrapy provides its own facility for sending e-mails which is "
"very easy to use and it's implemented using :doc:`Twisted non-blocking IO"
" <twisted:core/howto/defer-intro>`, to avoid interfering with the non-"
"blocking IO of the crawler. It also provides a simple API for sending "
"attachments and it's very easy to configure, with a few :ref:`settings "
"<topics-email-settings>`."
